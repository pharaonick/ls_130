This is my test file isn't it great don't you think when does it actually wrap round 
then this is the confusing thing from my perspective tbh.

So is this a new paragraph. I guess it must be, right? But what about the line wrapping, 
it's possible this is considered one line depending on how the MACHINE deals 
with this particular app I suppose. We'll find out once I run the program...

Final graf is final. Thank you and goodbye.
